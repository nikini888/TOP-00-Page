        <p>Noodles are one of my go to dishes when I need a quick hot meal. Toss in some vegetables and a bit of shrimp, and you’ll have a mouth-watering meal in 30 minutes or less! Disclosure: I received an OXO Non-Stick...</p>
        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

            <li>8 ounces (225g) dry thin rice noodles</li>
            <li>2 TBS olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound (450g) shrimp, shelled and deveined</li>
            <li>1/2 small yellow onion, sliced</li>
            <li>6 ounces (170g) snow peas</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (125g) mung bean sprouts</li>
            <li>1 TBS hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>1 TBS chili garlic sauce</li>
            <li>1 TBS low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 green onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the noodles in boiling hot water for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and let it cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the shrimp curls and turns orange. Pour the cooked shrimp on a plate, and wipe the pan down with a towel.</li>
        <li>Heat another tablespoon of olive oil in the pan. Add the onions. When they start to turn translucent, add the snow peas. Cover the pan with a lid for 2 to 3 minutes. If it looks like the pan is very dry, add a few tablespoons of water. Uncover the pan and add the mung beans sprouts and stir for another minute or two.</li>
        <li>Add the noodles, sauces, green onion, and garlic powder. Stir everything for another two minutes. Mix in the shrimp and red pepper flakes. Serve immediately.</li>
