    <p>These fresh Vietnamese spring rolls are made with shrimp, vegetables, herbs, and rice noodles wrapped in rice paper. Vietnamese spring rolls are traditionally served with nước chấm (a dip made of fish sauce), but they’re great with peanut sauce as well. </p>  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>18 medium shell-on shrimp (21/25 count)</li>
        <li>3 ounces thin rice vermicelli (maifun)</li>
        <li>1 large carrot</li>
        <li>1 to 1 1/2 Persian cucumber</li>
        <li>a large red bell pepper,</li>
        <li>1/2 cup loosely packed mint leaves</li>
        <li>12 pieces of butter lettuce</li>
        <li>12 large 22cm circular rice paper sheets</li>
        <li>warm water for rolling spring rolls</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Quickly dip a sheet of rice paper in the lukewarm water to moisten the entire surface. This should take no longer than a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Lay the wet rice paper on your work surface. Place a piece of butter lettuce close to the bottom edge of the rice paper. Arrange a small pinch each of rice noodles, carrots, cucumber, red bell pepper, and mint leaves over the center of the lettuce leaf (see note 7). </li>
        <li>Arrange 3 pieces of shrimp about 1 1/2 to 2 inches below the top edge of the rice paper. Make sure that the orange/pink side is facing down. </li>
        <li>Grab the lower edge of the rice paper and lettuce and start rolling up the spring roll. Once you have reached the shrimp, fold in the left and right sides. Finish rolling up the spring roll all the way to the end. </li>
        <li>Repeat the rolling process with the rest of the ingredients. If the chopping board is looking dry, brush some water over the board.</li>
        <li>Serve the spring rolls with the dipping sauce.</li>
